## YouTube Indistract

As a digital minimalist, I prefer to watch only the content from a carefully curated list of YouTube channels. However, there are times when I need to search for something specific, which inevitably requires visiting YouTube.

That’s exactly why I built this website. It’s a focused, distraction-free YouTube search tool designed to help you quickly find and watch the videos you’re looking for — and nothing else.
